# Development Stability Guide

## CSS Volatility Prevention

This guide explains how to prevent and handle CSS formatting issues during development.

## Root Cause Analysis

The CSS volatility was caused by:

1. **Deprecated Next.js Configuration**: The `appDir` experimental flag in Next.js 14.0.4 was causing instability
2. **Development Server Issues**: Next.js dev server occasionally fails to serve CSS files properly
3. **No Fallback System**: When CSS failed to load, there was no backup styling

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Next.js Configuration

**File**: `apps/web/next.config.js`

- ✅ Removed deprecated `appDir` experimental flag
- ✅ Added webpack stability configurations
- ✅ Added CSS caching headers
- ✅ Improved file watching for development

### 2. CSS Fallback System

**File**: `apps/web/src/styles/fallback.css`

- ✅ Critical CSS variables and styles always available
- ✅ Prevents unstyled content during server issues
- ✅ Includes all essential Tailwind classes
- ✅ Responsive design support

### 3. Health Monitoring

**File**: `scripts/dev-server-health.js`

- ✅ Monitors CSS serving every 5 seconds
- ✅ Automatically restarts dev server on failures
- ✅ Configurable retry limits
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

### 4. Improved Development Scripts

**File**: `apps/web/package.json`

- ✅ `dev:stable` - Stable development server
- ✅ `dev:monitor` - Health monitoring script
- ✅ Better error handling and recovery

## Usage Instructions

### Normal Development

```bash
# Start stable development server
cd apps/web
pnpm dev:stable
```

### With Health Monitoring

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server
cd apps/web
pnpm dev:stable

# Terminal 2: Start health monitor
pnpm dev:monitor
```

### Emergency Recovery

If CSS issues occur:

1. **Hard refresh browser**: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Clear browser cache** for localhost
3. **Restart dev server**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "next dev"
   cd apps/web && pnpm dev:stable
   ```
4. **Use health monitor** for automatic recovery

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Always Use Stable Configuration

- Use `dev:stable` instead of `dev`
- Monitor console for Next.js warnings
- Keep Next.js configuration up to date

### 2. CSS Fallback Always Active

- Fallback CSS is automatically loaded
- Provides basic styling even when main CSS fails
- No additional configuration needed

### 3. Health Monitoring

- Run health monitor during development
- Monitor logs for CSS serving issues
- Automatic recovery prevents manual intervention

### 4. Browser Best Practices

- Use hard refresh when seeing unstyled content
- Clear localhost cache periodically
- Use incognito mode for testing

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Page shows unstyled content

**Symptoms**: Plain text, no colors, no layout

**Solutions**:
1. Check if CSS file is loading: `curl http://localhost:3001/_next/static/css/app/layout.css`
2. Hard refresh browser
3. Restart dev server
4. Check health monitor logs

### Issue: CSS file returns 404

**Symptoms**: Browser shows 404 for CSS files

**Solutions**:
1. Restart development server
2. Clear `.next` cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Reinstall dependencies: `pnpm install`
4. Use health monitor for automatic recovery

### Issue: Inconsistent styling

**Symptoms**: Styling works sometimes, not others

**Solutions**:
1. Use `dev:stable` script
2. Enable health monitoring
3. Check for Next.js configuration warnings
4. Update to latest Next.js version

## Monitoring and Alerts

The health monitor provides:

- ✅ Real-time CSS serving status
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Server restart on persistent failures
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling

## Best Practices

1. **Always use stable scripts** for development
2. **Monitor console output** for warnings
3. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
4. **Use health monitoring** for critical development
5. **Test in multiple browsers** to catch issues early
6. **Clear cache periodically** to prevent stale issues

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add CSS integrity checking
- [ ] Implement CSS hot-reload monitoring
- [ ] Add browser extension for CSS health
- [ ] Create automated testing for CSS stability
- [ ] Add performance monitoring for CSS loading

## Support

If you encounter persistent CSS issues:

1. Check this guide first
2. Review health monitor logs
3. Test with fallback CSS only
4. Report issues with detailed logs
5. Consider updating Next.js version

**Remember**: The fallback CSS ensures your app always looks decent, even during development server issues. The health monitor prevents most issues automatically.
