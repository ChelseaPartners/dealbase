# Schema Improvements Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the schema improvements made to enhance the reliability and observability of the rent roll upload → process → load → Unit Mix pipeline.

## Database Model Enhancements

### DealDocument Model Updates
**File**: `apps/api/dealbase_api/models.py`

**Added Fields**:
- `processing_started_at`: Timestamp when processing actually began
- `processing_completed_at`: Timestamp when processing finished  
- `records_processed`: Number of units processed from the document
- `issues_found`: Number of data quality issues found during processing

**Added Indexes**:
- `deal_id`: Index for faster deal-scoped queries
- `file_hash`: Index for deduplication lookups
- `processing_status`: Index for status-based queries

### Benefits
1. **Performance**: Indexes improve query speed for common operations
2. **Observability**: Track processing duration and success metrics
3. **Debugging**: Identify bottlenecks and data quality issues
4. **Monitoring**: Measure pipeline health and performance

## API Enhancements

### Upload Endpoint Updates
**File**: `apps/api/dealbase_api/routers/intake.py`

**Changes**:
- Set `processing_started_at` when processing begins
- Track processing start time for performance monitoring

### Parser Service Updates  
**File**: `apps/api/dealbase_api/services/rentroll_parser.py`

**Changes**:
- Set `processing_completed_at` when processing finishes
- Record `records_processed` count for success metrics
- Record `issues_found` count for data quality tracking
- Enhanced logging with metrics

## Migration Script

### Database Migration
**File**: `apps/api/migrations/add_processing_metrics.sql`

**Actions**:
- Add new columns to `deal_documents` table
- Create performance indexes
- Add column comments for documentation
- Ensure backward compatibility

## Data Contract Documentation

### Comprehensive Documentation
**File**: `apps/api/DATA_CONTRACT.md`

**Contents**:
- Complete data model specifications
- Pipeline data flow documentation
- Data integrity rules and constraints
- Error handling strategies
- Performance considerations
- Security and privacy guidelines
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Improvements

### 1. Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints with CASCADE DELETE
- Unique constraints for unit numbers and file hashes
- Atomic transactions with savepoints
- Validation rules for data quality

### 2. Performance
- Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields
- Direct table queries to avoid stale cache
- Query optimization for hot paths
- Efficient storage with deduplication

### 3. Observability
- Processing timestamps for performance tracking
- Record counts for success metrics
- Issue counts for data quality monitoring
- Structured logging with context

### 4. Reliability
- Idempotent operations with file hashing
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Atomic persistence with rollback capability
- Error handling with detailed reporting

### 5. Maintainability
- Clear data contract documentation
- Migration scripts for schema evolution
- Comprehensive testing strategy
- Troubleshooting guides

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run the database migration script
2. Test the enhanced pipeline with sample data
3. Verify all new fields are properly populated

### Future Enhancements
1. Add batch processing capabilities
2. Implement real-time data validation
3. Add advanced error recovery mechanisms
4. Create performance dashboards

## Testing Recommendations

### Unit Tests
- Test new field population
- Verify index creation
- Validate data constraints

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end pipeline with metrics
- Verify processing timestamp accuracy
- Test error handling with new fields

### Performance Tests
- Measure query performance improvements
- Test processing time tracking accuracy
- Validate index effectiveness

## Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Upload Success Rate**: Percentage of successful uploads
2. **Processing Duration**: Time from start to completion
3. **Records Processed**: Volume of data processed
4. **Data Quality**: Number of issues found per upload
5. **Error Frequency**: Rate of processing failures

### Alerting Thresholds
1. Processing time > 5 minutes
2. Error rate > 10%
3. Data quality issues > 50 per upload
4. Upload failure rate > 5%

## Conclusion

These schema improvements provide a solid foundation for:
- Reliable data processing
- Performance monitoring
- Quality assurance
- Troubleshooting and debugging
- Future scalability

The enhanced data contract ensures long-term stability and maintainability of the rent roll processing pipeline.
